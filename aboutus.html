            <i>Our Choice</i> was created by four female scholars from the Kode With Klossy organization, who were tasked with developing a data visualization site on a significant topic. With a shared passion for healthcare, they chose to focus on an issue that deeply affects women and gender-fluid communities: the impact of the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade. Recognizing the urgency of this matter, we aimed to raise awareness about the societal consequences of restricting access to abortion.

            <br>
  Our site provides up-to-date information on the abortion status of nearly every state in the United States, along with visual data highlighting the decline in reproductive healthcare access. We encourage healthcare professionals, family members, policymakers, and all communities to educate themselves on the critical importance of ensuring accessible reproductive care for everyone. Additionally,             <i>Our Choice</i> serves as a safe space where individuals can find resources and share their experiences, creating an environment of support and understanding.
